The aim of this project is to rework the original [Traffic Flow Dynamics Model](https://github.com/Grufoony/TrafficFlowDynamicsModel).
This rework consists of a full code rewriting, in order to implement more features (like *intersections*) and get advantage from the latest C++ updates.

## Installation
The library is available on `PyPI`:
```shell
pip install dsf-mobility
```

To check the installation you can simply run
```python
import dsf

print(dsf.__version__)
```

## Installation (from source)

### Requirements
The project requires `C++20` or greater, `cmake`, `tbb` `simdjson`, `spdlog`, `csv-parser` and `SQLiteCpp`.
To install requirements on Ubuntu:
```shell
sudo apt install cmake libtbb-dev
```
To install requirements on macOS:
```shell
brew install cmake tbb
```

Utilities are written in python. To install their dependencies:
```shell
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
### Installation (C++)
The library can be installed using CMake. To build and install the project in the default folder run:
```shell
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
sudo cmake --install build
```
Otherwise, it is possible to customize the installation path:
```shell
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install
```
then building and installing it (eventually in sudo mode) with:
```shell
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

## Installation (Python)
If you want to use the library from Python, you can build the Python bindings using [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). Make sure you have Doxygen installed to generate the docstrings:
```shell
sudo apt install doxygen libtbb-dev
```

Then, the installation is automatic via `uv`:
```shell
uv build
```
or you can just use the classic `pip`:
```shell
pip install .
```

After installation, you should be able to import the module in Python:
```python
import dsf

print(dsf.__version__)
```

If you encounter issues, ensure that the installation path is in your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.

## Installation (Python - HPC Variant)

For high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and environments where binary portability is critical, an HPC-optimized wheel variant is available. This variant uses conservative `-O3` optimization instead of architecture-specific tuning (`-Ofast`, `-flto=auto`, `-march=native`), ensuring compatibility across diverse HPC hardware architectures.

### When to Use HPC Variant
- Deploying on HPC clusters with heterogeneous node architectures
- Avoiding runtime errors due to unsupported CPU instructions
- Maximizing portability across different compute nodes

### Installation on HPC Systems

The HPC build is published as a separate PyPI distribution named `dsf-mobility-hpc` (PEP-compliant), with Linux wheels intended for cluster portability. Install it directly with:

```shell
pip install dsf-mobility-hpc
```

Or with `uv`:

```shell
uv pip install dsf-mobility-hpc
```

If you need to download a wheel explicitly, use:

```shell
pip download --only-binary :all: dsf-mobility-hpc
```

### Wheel Filename Pattern on PyPI

HPC wheel filenames are standard and parseable by pip, for example:

```text
dsf_mobility_hpc-<version>-cp<pyver>-cp<pyver>-<platform_tag>.whl
```

Typical Linux example:

```text
dsf_mobility_hpc-5.3.1-cp312-cp312-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.whl
```

### Building HPC Variant Locally

To build the HPC variant locally for development or testing:

```shell
DSF_HPC_BUILD=1 pip install .
```

This uses conservative `-O3` optimization for maximum portability:

```shell
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDSF_HPC_BUILD=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

### Standard vs. HPC Variants

| Aspect | Standard | HPC |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Optimization** | `-Ofast -flto=auto` + optional `-march=native` | `-O3` only |
| **Use Case** | Single-system deployments, development | HPC clusters, portable deployments |
| **Performance** | Highest on optimized hardware | Portable across architectures |
| **Portability** | Variable (CPU-specific) | Maximum (all x86_64 CPUs) |
| **PyPI Package** | `dsf-mobility` | `dsf-mobility-hpc` |

## Testing
This project uses [Doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest) for testing.

If the project is compiled in `Debug` or `Coverage` mode, tests are always built.
Otherwise, you can add the `-DDSF_TESTS=ON` flag to enable test build.
```shell
cmake -B build -DDSF_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

To run the tests use the command:
```shell
ctest --test-dir build -j$(nproc) --output-on-failure
```

## Benchmarking
Some functionalities of the library have been benchmarked in order to assess their efficiency.  
The benchmarks are performed using [Google Benchmarks](https://github.com/google/benchmark).
To build the benchmarks add the flag `-DDSF_BENCHMARKS=ON` :
```shell
cmake -B build -DDSF_BENCHMARKS=ON
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```
To run all the benchmarks together use the command:
```shell
cd benchmark
for f in ./*.out ; do ./$f ; done
```
